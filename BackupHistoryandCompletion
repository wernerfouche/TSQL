## The following scripts will assist with finding out the SQL backup history and completion times of existing SQL backups

## The first script is to find out the backup history for all databases on the SQL Instance

SELECT   

   CONVERT(CHAR(100), SERVERPROPERTY('Servername')) AS Server,  

   msdb.dbo.backupset.database_name,

   msdb.dbo.backupmediafamily   

   INNER JOIN msdb.dbo.backupset ON msdb.dbo.backupmediafamily.media_set_id = msdb.dbo.backupset.media_set_id   

WHERE msdb..backupset.type = 'D'  

GROUP BY  

   msdb.dbo.backupset.database_name   

ORDER BY   

   msdb.dbo.backupset.database_name
